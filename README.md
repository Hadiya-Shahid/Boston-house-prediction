🏡 Boston house price prediction 
!Project Overview

This project predicts house prices using Random Forest Regression on the Boston Housing dataset.
The model leverages key housing features (e.g., crime rate, number of rooms, property tax rate) to estimate property prices.

The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end ML workflow, from data preprocessing to model deployment, while ensuring both performance and interpretability.
